# todoIOS
todoIOS is a simple app that was supposed to be a clone of [To-do list app](https://github.com/themaxsandelin/todo) made by [Max Sandelin](https://instagram.com/themaxsandelin)

The app was built in Swift and I started this app just for learning purposes! If you see any mistakes in my code or where I could do better feel free to point out.
